# WithYou

WithYou is a private, mobile-first application designed to help couples communicate needs and plan intentional connection time without pressure, surveillance, or judgment.

Built as a beta-ready v1 to demonstrate full-stack product engineering, WithYou focuses on consent-based pairing, indirect communication signals, and privacy-first architecture.
